# Notice component

A very simple component to display a message on a color coded background.

For now the component doesn't support lifecycle like the ability to dismiss it and I don't think I ever want to incorporate that, that should remain the reponsibility of the component using this one.

TODO:

-   Make it use the newcss theme colors?
-   Probably allow to tweak the style of the component, for now it is a simple `div` and it is always used in the whole width of the screen, there will certainly be some cases where I need to tweak that.
