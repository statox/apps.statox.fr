You can access some

        data (theoretically) requires to login as myself, so you shouldn't be able to do it. (The
        authentication used to be handled via <a target="_blank" href="https://auth0.com/">auth0</a> and used Github as the identity provider. Now our own api uses passportJS to handle login and
        session cookies and we use the browsers built-in cookie handling to authenticate calls after
        the initial \`/auth/login\`.</div> <br/> <div>If you are trying to find out more about me, you probably want to check out my blog <a target="_blank" href="https://www.statox.fr/">statox.fr</a> where I discuss some of the applications
